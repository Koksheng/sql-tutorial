# Magic School

Suppose there is a magic school where many students are studying and taking exams in different subjects. Design a table named `magic_scores` to record the exam scores of each student in different subjects. The table fields are as follows:

- `student_id`: Student ID, uniquely identifying each student.
- `student_name`: Student name.
- `subject_id`: Subject ID, uniquely identifying each subject.
- `subject_name`: Subject name.
- `score`: The student's exam score in the subject.

Write an SQL query to output the Student ID (`student_id`), Student Name (`student_name`), Subject ID (`subject_id`), Subject Name (`subject_name`), Student's exam score in the subject (`score`), and the student's ranking in each subject based on scores (`score_rank`). Sort the result by score in descending order.
